# Master_thesis
Backup of codes and report on my Master's thesis. Included are some of the final codes, which I didn't have time to optimize, so there is some duplicate code. The idea was to 
develop an epidemiological model of malaria transmission, which includes both vector and human populations, and investigate this model using the adaptive dynamics approach to
see under what circumstances the R0 optimisation-paradigm breaks down.
