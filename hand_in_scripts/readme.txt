The matematical_relationships_malaria is about the mathematical realationships in the malaria model, as discussed in section 3 of the thesis.
The iterative_sim script is also for section 3, where there is a subsection named "simulating the populations". 
The malaria_and_rzero_breakdown script is for the R0 breakdown section of malaria. There, the same operation is done 4 times, so it certainly isn't well
optimised, but I wrote it that way originally to avoid any potential mistakes.
The sir_and_rzero_breakdown script is for the R0 breakdown section for the SIR model.
